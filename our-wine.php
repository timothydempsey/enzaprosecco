<h1>OUR WINE</h1>
<p><strong>Taste Profile</strong><br>
  Enza Prosecco is made from 100% Glera (Prosecco) grapes grown in the Prosecco DOC region in Northeastern Italy in vineyards lying between Conegliano Veneto and Valdobbiadene.</p>
<p>Just the right balance of acidity and sugar transform Enza into a delicate sparkling wine. The bouquet bursts with fruity scents of pear and green apples with a light floral and citrus note. On the palate, Enza exhibits the same fruit characteristics as in the bouquet enhanced with a touch of peach and honeysuckle.</p>
<p>Grape Variety; 100% Glera (Prosecco) grapes<br>
  Alcohol: 11% ABV<br>
  Acidity: 6.1 g/l<br>
  Residual Sugar: 16 g/l<br>
  Vintage: NV</p>
<p><strong>Food Pairings</strong><br>
  Crisp and refreshing with perfectly balanced acidity, Enza is the perfect for pairing for almost any cuisine or occasion. Try it as an aperitif accompanying traditional Italian meats and cheese from the Veneto region or with pasta or seafood. Why not enjoy a bottle over a romantic dinner on the patio with someone special or toast to the weekend at brunch with a group of friends. No matter the occasion, Enza is the perfect pairing to make your everyday extraordinary!</p>
